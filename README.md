## My process

I first did some research about BEM notation, then proceeded to do a basic HTML skeleton and styled it using CSS and keeping in mind the notation as I named the different classes and ids.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM notation

### What I learned

There is a very useful way to keep your project organized with BEM notation. I would like to learn how to do the rating system with stars, as the example showed. I will likely research this in the near future.

### Continued development
